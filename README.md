<b>Symbolic AI </b> <br>
(Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence). Machines were initially designed to formulate outputs based on the inputs that were represented by symbols. The symbolic approach says that the best way to teach an AI is to feed it human-readable information related to what you think it needs to know. The representations are also written in a human-level understandable language.
